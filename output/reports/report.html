Executive Summary:

The A/B test compared a control group with a test group to evaluate the impact of a new product feature on conversion rate. The results indicate a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate for the test group compared to the control group. While the effect size is small, the consistent statistical significance from both the t-test and chi-squared test suggests a real, positive impact of the new feature.

Detailed Analysis:

Conversion Rate:
The control group exhibited a conversion rate of 10.8%, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 8.1% to 13.6%. The test group showed a higher conversion rate of 16.9%, with a 95% confidence interval of 13.6% to 20.1%. The confidence intervals do not overlap, suggesting a meaningful difference between the two groups.

Statistical Significance:
Two statistical tests were performed to assess the significance of the observed difference:

T-Test: The t-test yielded a test statistic of -2.781 and a p-value of 0.0055. The p-value is less than the standard significance level of 0.05, indicating that the difference in conversion rates between the control and test groups is statistically significant. The null hypothesis (no difference between the groups) is rejected.

Chi-Squared Test: The chi-squared test resulted in a test statistic of 7.137 and a p-value of 0.0076. Similar to the t-test, this p-value is also less than 0.05, confirming the statistical significance of the observed difference. The chi-squared test further supports rejecting the null hypothesis.

Effect Size:
Cohen's d was calculated to quantify the effect size, resulting in a value of 0.176. According to standard interpretations, this represents a small effect size. While the improvement is statistically significant, the practical magnitude of the effect is relatively small.

Recommendations:

1. Implementation: Given the statistically significant improvement in conversion rate observed in the test group, it is recommended to proceed with the implementation of the new product feature. Even a small effect size can translate to substantial gains when scaled across a large user base.

2. Further Investigation: Although the initial results are positive, further investigation is warranted to understand the underlying reasons for the improvement. User behavior analytics, qualitative feedback, and additional A/B tests could help to pinpoint which specific aspects of the new feature are driving the increase in conversion rate.

3. Long-Term Monitoring: Post-implementation, closely monitor the conversion rate and other relevant metrics to ensure the observed gains are sustained over time. Monitor for any unintended consequences or side effects of the new feature.

4. Iteration and Optimization: The small effect size suggests that there is still room for improvement. Continue to iterate on the new feature based on user feedback and further A/B testing to maximize its impact on conversion rate. Explore different variations of the feature and conduct targeted experiments to identify the most effective implementations.

Conclusion:

The A/B test results indicate a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate with the new product feature. While the effect size is small, the consistent statistical significance justifies proceeding with implementation, along with ongoing monitoring, investigation, and optimization.
